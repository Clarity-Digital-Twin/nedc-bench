# IRA Kappa Fix - TRUE 100% Parity Achieved!

**Date:** September 15, 2025
**Issue:** IRA kappa was 0.1888 (Beta) vs 0.1887 (Alpha)
**Status:** ✅ FIXED - Now EXACT match!

## The Investigation

We noticed IRA had a tiny difference:
- Alpha: 0.1887 (displayed with 4 decimals in NEDC output)
- Beta: 0.18878069 (would round to 0.1888)

This seemed like a rounding difference, but it was actually a **real implementation bug**.

## Root Cause Discovery

### 1. Confusion Matrix Analysis

When we compared the aggregated confusion matrices, we found:

```
DIFFERENCES (Beta - Alpha):
  seiz -> seiz: +9
  seiz -> bckg: -9
  bckg -> seiz: +13
  bckg -> bckg: -13
```

**This is the EXACT SAME pattern we saw in the Epoch algorithm!**

### 2. The Connection

Both IRA and Epoch:
- Use epoch-based sampling at 0.25s intervals
- Sample at midpoints (0.125s, 0.375s, 0.625s, ...)
- Build confusion matrices from sampled labels

### 3. The Missing Piece

NEDC augments annotations to fill ALL gaps with background events:
- If there's a gap between events → fill with background
- If there's a gap at the start → fill with background
- If there's a gap at the end → fill with background

Our implementation only augmented when files had NO events at all.

## The Fix

We applied the same augmentation strategy to IRA as we did for Epoch:

```python
def augment_events_full(events, file_duration, null_class):
    """Augment events with background to fill ALL gaps (like NEDC does)."""
    if not events:
        return [background_event_for_entire_duration]

    augmented = []
    curr_time = 0.0

    for ev in sorted(events, key=lambda x: x.start_time):
        # Fill gap before this event
        if curr_time < ev.start_time:
            augmented.append(background_event_for_gap)
        augmented.append(ev)
        curr_time = ev.stop_time

    # Fill gap at end
    if curr_time < file_duration:
        augmented.append(background_event_for_gap)

    return augmented
```

## Results

### Before Fix:
- Beta confusion: seiz→seiz=33713, seiz→bckg=250450, bckg→seiz=18829, bckg→bckg=5968385
- Beta kappa: 0.18878068973076786
- Alpha kappa: 0.18874384538128447
- Difference: 0.00003684

### After Fix:
- Beta confusion: seiz→seiz=33704, seiz→bckg=250459, bckg→seiz=18816, bckg→bckg=5968398
- Beta kappa: 0.18874384538128447
- Alpha kappa: 0.18874384538128447
- Difference: 0.00000000 (EXACT MATCH!)

## Key Learnings

1. **Small differences matter**: A 0.0001 kappa difference revealed a real bug
2. **Consistency is critical**: Both Epoch and IRA needed the same augmentation
3. **NEDC's preprocessing**: Always augments to ensure continuous annotation coverage
4. **Shared implementations**: When algorithms share techniques (epoch sampling), they need the same fixes

## Impact

With this fix:
- IRA now has **EXACT** parity with NEDC v6.0.0
- The confusion matrices match perfectly (all 4 cells)
- Both round to 0.1887 when displayed with 4 decimals
- All 5 NEDC algorithms now have TRUE 100% parity!

## Files Modified

- `scripts/run_beta_ira.py`: Added full augmentation function
- `SSOT_BETA.json`: Updated with corrected kappa values

## Conclusion

What seemed like a minor rounding difference (0.1887 vs 0.1888) was actually a real implementation bug. The same augmentation issue that affected Epoch also affected IRA because both use epoch-based sampling. With this fix, we now have **TRUE 100% algorithmic fidelity** across all 5 NEDC algorithms!
