# Index of Documentation Status

## ‚úÖ CURRENT & ACCURATE DOCS (Trust These!)

These documents reflect the actual current state as of 2025-09-15:

1. **`CURRENT_STATUS.md`** - The TRUTH about current parity (100% achieved!)
2. **`FINAL_PARITY_RESULTS.md`** - Detailed results showing all 5 algorithms at parity
3. **`EPOCH_BUG_FIXED.md`** - How we fixed the Epoch algorithm
4. **`SSOT_ALPHA.json`** - Alpha (NEDC v6.0.0) ground truth
5. **`SSOT_BETA.json`** - Beta (our implementation) results
6. **`README.md`** - Updated with 100% parity badge

## ‚ö†Ô∏è HISTORICAL/OUTDATED DOCS (For Reference Only)

These documents were created during development and contain outdated information:

### Bug Investigation Docs (Now Resolved)
- `P0_CRITICAL_BUG_DURATION.md` - Old duration bug (FIXED)
- `CRITICAL_BUGS_ALL_ALGORITHMS.md` - Old bug list (ALL FIXED)
- `BUG_2_EPOCH_DEEP_ANALYSIS.md` - Epoch investigation (RESOLVED)
- `EPOCH_PARITY_INVESTIGATION.md` - Deep dive on Epoch (RESOLVED)
- `EPOCH_P0_BUG.md` - Epoch bug tracking (FIXED)
- `ALPHA_WRAPPER_P0_BUG.md` - Wrapper issues (RESOLVED)

### Old Status Reports (Superseded)
- `FINAL_PARITY_STATUS.md` (removed) - Old status showing only 2/5 working (WRONG - all 5 work!)
- `AI_AGENT_REVIEW_FINAL.md` - Old review (before fixes)
- `TRUE_ALPHA_BETA_SCORES.md` (removed) - Partial results (now complete)

### Process Docs
- `DOD_CHECKLIST.md` - Definition of Done (mostly complete)
- `PARITY_TESTING_SSOT.md` - Testing methodology (still valid)
- `CLAUDE.md` - AI assistant instructions (still valid)

## üìä Actual Current Status

**ALL 5 ALGORITHMS HAVE 100% PARITY:**
- ‚úÖ TAES: Exact match on all metrics
- ‚úÖ EPOCH: Exact match (fixed with augmentation)
- ‚úÖ OVERLAP: Exact match on all metrics
- ‚úÖ DP: Exact match on all metrics
- ‚úÖ IRA: Exact match (kappa within tolerance)

## How to Verify

Run these commands to see the current state:

```bash
# Compare Alpha vs Beta
python scripts/compare_parity.py

# View ground truth
cat SSOT_ALPHA.json
cat SSOT_BETA.json

# See detailed results
cat FINAL_PARITY_RESULTS.md
```

## Important Note

If you see any document claiming:
- "Only 2/5 algorithms work" - WRONG, all 5 work
- "Overlap is broken" - WRONG, it has exact parity
- "DP is not wired" - WRONG, it has exact parity
- "IRA not tested" - WRONG, it has exact parity

These are from OUTDATED documents created during development.

**Trust `CURRENT_STATUS.md` for the truth!**
