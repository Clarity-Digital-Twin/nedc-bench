# Documentation Home

This repository contains a complete, validated reimplementation of the NEDC EEG evaluation suite with a dual‑pipeline architecture (Alpha = original tool, Beta = modern rewrite) and 100% parity across all five algorithms.

Use this page to navigate the canonical, up‑to‑date documents. Historical notes and investigation logs are preserved under docs/archive/.
