## ‚úÖ TAES - PERFECT PARITY ACHIEVED

**Status**: 100% Complete
```
Alpha: TP=133.84, FP=552.77, FN=941.16, Sens=12.45%, FA/24h=30.46
Beta:  TP=133.84, FP=552.77, FN=941.16, Sens=12.45%, FA/24h=30.46
```

**What We Fixed**:
1. Duration calculation (was using max, now using sum)
2. Proper duration from file metadata

---

## ‚úÖ Epoch - 99.97% PERFECT

**Status**: Functionally Complete
```
Alpha: TP=33704, FP=18816, FN=250459, Sens=11.86%
Beta:  TP=33713, FP=18829, FN=250450, Sens=11.86%
Diff:  TP=9,     FP=13,    FN=9 (0.03% error)
```

**What We Fixed**:
1. Added `true_positives`, `false_positives`, `false_negatives` properties
2. Changed epoch_duration from 1.0 to 0.25 seconds
3. Changed null_class from "null" to "bckg"

**Remaining Issue**:
- FA/24h shows 1037.6 vs 259.2 (4x difference)
- This is because NEDC Epoch divides FP by 4 for FA/24h calculation
- Core algorithm is PERFECT, just reporting difference

---

## ‚ùå Overlap - BROKEN

**Status**: Wrong Results
```
Alpha: TP=253, FP=536, FN=822, Sens=23.53%
Beta:  TP=253, FP=174, FN=36,  Sens=87.54%
```

**Root Cause Analysis**:
1. TP matches perfectly (253) - overlap detection works
2. FP way too low (174 vs 536) - missing false alarms
3. FN way too low (36 vs 822) - missing misses

**The Bug**:
Our implementation appears correct based on NEDC source review. The issue might be:
1. Files with no seizures not being counted properly
2. Label filtering happening differently
3. Event preprocessing (merging/filtering) not matching

**Fix Required**:
- Deep debug of specific files with large discrepancies
- Verify no event filtering/merging happening in NEDC
- Check if background events affect counts

## ‚ùå DP Alignment - NOT WIRED

**Status**: Not Running
```
Alpha: TP=328, FP=966, FN=747, Sens=30.51%, FA/24h=53.23
Beta:  Not running
```

**Issue**:
- DP needs label sequences, not event lists
- We pass EventAnnotation objects, it needs string arrays

**Fix Required**:
```python
def events_to_label_sequence(events, duration, epoch_duration=0.25):
    """Convert events to epoch label sequence"""
    n_epochs = int(np.ceil(duration / epoch_duration))
    labels = ["bckg"] * n_epochs

    for event in events:
        start_epoch = int(event.start_time / epoch_duration)
        end_epoch = int(np.ceil(event.stop_time / epoch_duration))
        for i in range(start_epoch, min(end_epoch, n_epochs)):
            labels[i] = event.label

    return labels
```

---

## ‚ùå IRA - NOT TESTED

**Status**: Not Integrated
```
Alpha: Multi-Class Kappa = 0.1887
Beta:  Not tested
```

**Issue**:
- IRA returns Kappa, not TP/FP/FN
- Needs same epoch sequences as DP

**Fix Required**:
- Use same epochization as DP
- Return Kappa value directly
- Don't try to extract TP/FP/FN

---

## Summary of Fixes Completed

### Duration Bug (P0) ‚úÖ
- Fixed calculation from max to sum
- Now reads duration from CSV_BI metadata
- All algorithms use same total_duration

### Epoch Properties (P0) ‚úÖ
- Added TP/FP/FN properties to EpochResult
- Fixed epoch_duration (0.25s)
- Fixed null_class ("bckg")

### Test Infrastructure ‚úÖ
- Created comprehensive test suite
- Added duration calculation tests
- Built ultimate parity test script

---

## Remaining Work

1. **Overlap Debug** (P0)
   - Find why FP/FN are wrong
   - Test event filtering/preprocessing
   - Verify label handling

2. **DP Alignment Wiring** (P0)
   - Add sequence converter
   - Load penalties from params
   - Wire into test script

3. **IRA Integration** (P1)
   - Add Kappa calculation
   - Use same sequences as DP
   - Handle different metric type

4. **Epoch FA/24h** (P2)
   - Understand why NEDC divides by 4
   - Document or match behavior

---

## Test Data Summary

- **Files**: 1832 reference + 1832 hypothesis
- **Duration**: 1,567,844.73 seconds total
- **Source**: SeizureTransformer outputs on TUSZ DEV
- **Format**: CSV_BI v1.0.0

---

## Next Steps

1. Debug Overlap with specific file analysis
2. Wire DP Alignment with sequence conversion
3. Add IRA with Kappa metric
4. Document all NEDC quirks found
5. Create regression test suite

**Critical**: Cannot deploy until ALL algorithms achieve parity!
