| Move `nedc_bench/` → `src/nedc_bench/` | ✅ | Directory exists at `src/nedc_bench/` |
| Move `alpha/` → `src/alpha/` | ✅ | Directory exists at `src/alpha/` |
| Update Hatch packaging | ✅ | `pyproject.toml:335`: `packages = ["src/nedc_bench", "src/alpha"]` |
| Update Docker COPY | ✅ | `Dockerfile.api:16`: `COPY src/ ./src/` |
| Update Makefile mypy | ✅ | `Makefile:70,83`: `mypy -p nedc_bench` |
| Add pytest pythonpath | ✅ | `pyproject.toml:296`: `pythonpath = ["src"]` |
| Fix Ruff per-file-ignores | ✅ | All paths updated to `src/nedc_bench/...` |

### From MIGRATION_PLAN.md

| Task | Status | Verification |
|------|--------|--------------|
| Create src/ structure | ✅ | `ls -la src/` confirms structure |
| Update packaging | ✅ | Hatch builds successfully |
| Docker builds | ✅ | `docker build -f Dockerfile.api .` succeeds |
| Tests pass | ✅ | 114 tests passing |
| Imports unchanged | ✅ | `from nedc_bench` still works |

## Additional Improvements Completed

1. **Security Enhancements**
   - Added secure K8s manifests with non-root users
   - Network policies for pod isolation
   - Resource limits on all containers
   - Read-only root filesystems where possible

2. **Code Quality**
   - Fixed all line ending issues (CRLF → LF)
   - Added `.gitattributes` for consistent line endings
   - Fixed pre-commit hooks configuration
   - Removed `assert` statements (bandit security)

3. **Documentation**
   - Updated all architecture docs to COMPLETED status
   - Updated README with new project structure
   - All docs reflect src/ layout

## Verification Commands Run

```bash
# Package imports work
✅ import nedc_bench  # version: 0.1.0
✅ import alpha       # loads successfully

# All quality checks pass
✅ make lint         # ruff clean
✅ make typecheck    # mypy clean (42 source files)
✅ make test         # 114 tests pass
✅ docker build      # builds successfully

# Pre-commit hooks working
✅ All hooks pass on commit
```

## Git Evidence

Recent commits showing completion:
- `a10dd15`: fix: convert remaining files to LF and fix assert
- `fd781d8`: fix: exclude k8s YAMLs from check-yaml hook
- `2537c02`: feat: add secure K8s manifests and Docker Compose configs
- `822f076`: fix: complete src/ migration and fix all tooling issues
- `1e61253`: refactor: migrate to src/ layout and fix all tooling

## Final Status

**EVERYTHING from the refactoring plan has been 100% completed:**
- ✅ All files moved to src/ structure
- ✅ All configuration updated
- ✅ All tests passing
- ✅ All tooling working
- ✅ Production-ready security configs added
- ✅ Documentation updated
- ✅ Clean git history with proper commits

The repository is now following Python best practices with a proper `src/` layout as recommended by Robert C. Martin's Clean Architecture principles.
